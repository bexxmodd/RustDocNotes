Next, we need some way to actually get data from the file
system so we can process it, and write it back when we’re done.
Rust has a robust set of tools for input and output, but the 
designers of the standard library know that reading and writing 
files is very common, and they’ve made it easy on purpose. All we 
need to do is import one module, std::fs, and we get access to the 
read_to_string and write functions.
